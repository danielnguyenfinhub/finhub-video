// A single tall caret (the remocn text cursor) sweeps across the frame in one
// eased pass. The caret IS the wipe boundary: the region it has PASSED shows
// the incoming scene (freshly "typed in" — it settles down and un-blurs just
// behind the caret), while the region it has NOT reached still shows the
// outgoing scene (being "backspaced" — it lifts and blurs as it's consumed).
//
// Both scenes share whatever backdrop sits behind the TransitionSeries, so the
// complementary clips never expose a seam. Pure frame-driven interpolate — no
// CSS keyframes — so it seeks correctly and renders identically every time.
